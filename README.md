download and setup with (genn becomes a global command so you can use it anywhere)

corect.cpp: the correct code
main.cpp: the code you try to verify if it's correct
gen.cpp: the code that generates the tests

exemple of genn commend usage:
  genn (you don't need to add anything if the files are named main.cpp/corect.cpp/gen.cpp/)
  otherwise you need to add them in the order: main,corect,gen
  optionally you can add the number of test to verify if you added the file names
